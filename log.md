# 100 Days Code - Log 

### Day 1: January 03, Tuesday
**Today's Progress** Some Markdown with help from the official site: 
[Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
**Thoughts**This is my third start of 100 Days of Code.  I did the first 100
and carried on to do another 50 Days.  During that time I did FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn
Enki ... And although I managed to code at  least an hour each day I did not
get around to keeping this log on Github. So having spent time regularly visiting 
Through December then halfway through finding (#Commitmas-3 Reurn of Commitmas)[https://github.com/gipsi/commitmas-3-return-of-commitmas/blob/master/README.md]
